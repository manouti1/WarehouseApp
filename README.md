# WarehouseApp

The following app is a micro shopping cart with backend using node and frontend using vuejs.


# Folder Structure

## backend
The following has the backend code for the application using nodejs. To get started in running the application you need to have nodejs installed on your machine.

 1. open commandline and run **`npm install`** (this will install node_modules on your backend)
 2. run **`npm start`** to run locally
*In order to run the tests(we used integration tests using jest, chai, supertest) you need to run the following command **`npm run test`***

## frontend

The frontend mainly uses vuejs as the frontend framework. In order to run the frontend, you need to open new command line in parallel with backend and run **`npm run dev`** that will run the application in dev environment


*Enhancement for later: To create a way to run both applications in single command.*
